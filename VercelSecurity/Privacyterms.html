      <p><em>Last Updated on July 1, 2024</em></p>
      <p>
        At The New York Times Company, our mission is to seek the truth and help
        people understand the world. We want you to understand how we handle
        your personal information. We also want you to know your rights and
        choices.
      </p>
      <p>
        This policy describes how we handle your personal information when you
        use the following “Times Services”:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The New York Times print newspaper, plus our print International
          Edition
        </li>
        <li>
          Our websites, like <em>nytimes.com</em> and its subdomains including
          <em>The Athletic</em> and <em>Wirecutter</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          Our apps, like <em>The New York Times app</em> and
          <em>The New York Times Games app</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          Our email newsletters, like <em>Cooking</em> and
          <em>Morning Briefing</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          Our pages or ads on social media networks, like our Facebook and
          Instagram pages
        </li>
        <li>
          Anywhere we gather information from or about you and refer you to this
          Privacy Policy<br />
          How we handle information about you depends on which Times Services
          you use and how you use them. For example, we use different
          information about print subscribers than website visitors.<br /><br />
          Be aware that certain Times Services work differently. Some have
          additional terms that supplement this policy (e.g., Reader
          Submissions).<br /><br />
          If you have questions, please don’t hesitate to contact us at
          privacy@nytimes.com. You can also review our Privacy F.A.Q.<br /><br />

          1. What Information Do We Gather About You?<br /><br />
          The information we gather about you depends on the context. By and
          large, it’s information about you that can personally identify you —
          either on its own or when combined with other information.<br /><br />

          The following describes the information we collect and how we obtain
          it.
          <li>For Registration:</li>
          When you sign up for a Times Service (whether via a subscription or a free account as a registered user), we collect personal identifiers such as your contact information, including your name and email address, and account credentials. We may also ask you to create an account name. Once you’re registered, we assign you a unique ID number. This ID number helps us recognize you when you’re signed in.<br><br>

For some Times Services, you can instead sign up by linking your Apple, Facebook or Google account. See Information Collected From Other Sources below.
        <li>For Billing:</li>
        To process payments or donations, we collect and use your payment information. This can include your name, your address, your telephone number, your email address, your credit or debit card information and any other relevant information.
</li>
      </ul>
